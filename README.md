# FMwithD3

I reduced the number of records (than in twitter demo) due to the limit size of upload file.  
(Mac Only: FMwithD3.fmp12)


I remade this to achieve cross-platform. (FMwithD3v5.fmp12)  

Some caveat:  
Now it works on Win and Mac.  
But I had to downgrade D3 version from 6 to 5 for Windows.  
d3.rollup/d3.group are not available in v5.   
Previous way is less intuitive. And also in IE11 Arrow Function is not supported. It makes readability worse.
